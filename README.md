# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial as delay can lead to an increase in costs and a progressive lack of user's trust. PMs can ensure timely delivery by breaking tasks into sizeable chunks (called sprints) and ensuring everyone meets up with deadlines. This can be effected by using stand-ups to know where everyone is in their assigned tasks.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control helps to maximize profits. Strategies to help prevent budget overruns include; avoiding unnecessary features, regular budget tracking and a clear project scope.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is iterative and flexible while waterfall is seequntial and rigid. Agile's main advantage is it's ability to ensure that there's a product available to users pending when the final product is ready. Waterfall on the other hand has a main advantage of having a sequential and structured approach to development.  
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial in evolving projects with flexible requirements, say a startup trying to deliver a mobile application. Waterfall is more beneficial in projects with fixed requirements, say a government related contract where all the requirements for the project are laid down before the commencement of the project.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality assurance ensures the reliability of a project through various types of testing and code reviews. It is important to maintain high standards as it helps to secure the maximum trust of users.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the scope of a project helps to ensure that the limits of a project are well understood so no one has high expectations and so that the boundaries are well set for everyone. WBS is breaking down the project into small tasks, this helps to easily manage the project.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule helps to prevent delays in delivery and completion of tasks.Gantt charts assist by creating a visual representation of ongoing tasks and helps in tracking the progress of task completion.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Software should address a real-world problem. This is significant to the target audience as the kind of problem being solved would determine the kind of potential users for a software. If I have a software solving an agro-related problem, then my target audience would be farmers but if it's a software that solves a problem related to curriculum development, then the target audience would be teachers and educators generally.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
When the problem is clearly defined, it helps to have a very defined project scope therefore ensuring that resources are not wasted building unnecessary features.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
This is where pitch decks come in. The mantra is to keep it simple, silly (KISS).
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
The unique features or functionality that make software stand out are those solutions embodied by the software that enable it to solve the defined problem most effectively and efficiently.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Target audience to understand market size, market trends to understand growth potential and a comprehensive review of competitors to understand what the market demands are.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Market trends help to identify the needs of users and ensures that relevant features are built into the software
